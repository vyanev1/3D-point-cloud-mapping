# Development and Implementation of 3D Point Cloud Mapping Algorithms

## Description:

Uses an artificially created calibration object to estimate the transformation matrix (translation & rotation) and construct a 3D Point Cloud map from a limited number of views captured from a Xbox Kinect V1 LiDAR camera.

This project is built on top of the [Point Cloud Library (PCL)](https://github.com/pointCloudLibrary/pcl), a large-scale open-source project for 2D/3D image and point cloud processing.
